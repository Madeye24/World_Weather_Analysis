# World_Weather_Analysis

# Background

PLANMYTRIP is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is the head of analysis for the user interface team. He's asked you to help him collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.

# Purpose
To let the travels decide which hotels and location are best for travelling, 
This data will help your team predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. Finally, you will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on certain weather criteria, and then map these cities using Jupyter and the Google Places API. 

Here's an outline of your project plan:
* Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
* Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
* Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

Over all this challenge was really hard but ver informative.
